## Project Overview  
This project analyzes grocery sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, store performance, and customer preferences. The dashboard visualizes key metrics using Excel pivot tables and charts.

## Objectives  
- Identify sales trends across different years.  
- Analyze store-wise and category-wise sales performance.  
- Evaluate product ratings and customer preferences.  
- Segment store performance by tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset contains grocery sales data with the following key attributes:  
- **Yearly Sales**: Aggregated sales from 2011 to 2014.  
- **Store Locations**: Identified by unique store IDs (OUT010, OUT013, etc.).  
- **Product Categories**: Includes items like Baking Goods, Breads, Breakfast, etc.  
- **Sales Segmentation**: Categorized by store tiers.  
- **Customer Ratings**: Average ratings for different product categories.  

## Features of the Dashboard  
### üìä Pivot Tables & Charts  
- Yearly sales trends visualization.  
- Store-wise and category-wise sales breakdown.  
- Sales contribution across different store tiers.  

### üéõÔ∏è Interactive Filters

### üìà Performance Insights  
- Identifies best-selling categories and high-revenue stores.

## Technical Implementation  
- **Excel Functions**: Used Pivot Tables and VLOOKUP for data aggregation.  
- **Data Visualization**: Implemented bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing values.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the Excel file and navigate to the **Dashboard** sheet.  
2. Use slicers to filter data dynamically.
